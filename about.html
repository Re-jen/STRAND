          <p> Choosing a track is critical for making a student highly proficient in the field where his or her chosen track is related to, especially if the student wishes to work immediately after graduating from SHS. As most educators say, a mismatch in the track and the student's interests, personality, and passion may lead to a poorly knowledgeable graduate who will find it hard to compete in the job market or keep up with other students when he or she goes to college.  </p>

          <p class="dark"> The creator of this website is a firm believer that education is truly important and absolutely believes that it is vital to choose the right strand in SHS for this will benefit you in so many ways once you enter college and that is why we decided to make this website</p>
